    <p>There were challenges when I was doing each part. In part one I did not know how to correctly shift each character by 1. But the professor also provided a hint of that part, so I basically just kept trying different code until displaying the correct format. To be honest, this part is my favorite part, even though it wasn’t a very hard challenge, it was still an interesting task and important challenge in terms of manipulating data.
        <br><br>
        The way I trouble shooting was to put “console.log” in every result. So that I can know if the “if” condition or “for” loop has successfully been created or if the code inside the loop is wrong. If I don’t have any knowledge of the code, such as “concat” or “charCodeAt”, I will search the code’s introduction on W3school.com or check the lecturer's slides. If necessary, I will ask AI  for an advanced way to use it. Sometimes I finish the code but it does not work correctly or I do not understand the explanation of the task. I will ask professors in lecture class and lab class. Or ask AI to give me an example of the task, but not including code.

        I learned that we can use “document.write” to create a structure and use “document.write("div")” to style it. I still do not fully understand it, but this was my biggest take away when doing this assignment.

        The hardest part is definitely to put those at the bottom right of the web page. When I was doing this part, I had totally no idea, so I gave up directly and started to search the lecturer’s slides, and google it. Finally I found a way to solve the problem.
        <br><br>
        Overall, it was a fun assignment of all three assignments.
