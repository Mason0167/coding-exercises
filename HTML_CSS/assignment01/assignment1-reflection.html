    <p>As an international student, I think the hardest part is not coding. In fact, I have not encountered any coding problems. However, sometimes I misunderstood the assignment requirements because English is not my first language. For example, I was very confused when I read the assignment instructions at the first time. I have to read every single word very carefully, or I might make some mistakes.</p>
    <p>I did not encounter any coding issues, partly because I have very little experience with coding. I also noticed there is little similarity with the language I learned visual basic for only a month five years ago. For example, punctuation like colon and so on, plays an important role. While I did not know the difference between document-relative and root-relative links. So, I just used root-relative to write every relative link that assignment instruction tell us to do until I accidentally saw the Week 4 practice. I would say that was lucky!</p>
    <p>I have learned a lot about web management. Although it is only the fifth week, I am still really happy and enjoying the course. I am pleased to see the immediate changes on the website when typing or modifying codes in the IDE. The sense of achievement I feel when finishing a practice, exercise, or assignment is wonderful. Additionally, all the stuff we have learned in  lab classes, like using CSS to decorate the website and HTML to create a web page from zero, has been interesting.</p>
    <p>So, I am enjoying coding right now and exciting about the upcoming courses in T141. Aslo, I am ready for the challenges that I will face.</p>
