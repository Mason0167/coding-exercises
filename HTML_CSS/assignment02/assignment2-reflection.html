    <p>This assignment took me more than 17 hours to complete, yet I really enjoyed the process of designing a web page. I encountered a lot of challenges. For example, deciding which color I should use in HTML. Although I knew that was one of the least important aspects of this assignment, I could not help trying to design it despite my lack of art talent. The biggest challenge I faced was the “float” property. It is hard to understand just by listening to the lecture without actually playing with it; I still cannot say I am one hundred percent sure how it works, but now, I can manage most situations.

        When I was dealing with the “float”, I tried to understand how it floats. So I added borders to the involved selectors and tested different combinations to find out what the pattern is. If I spent more than 30 minutes or 1 hour on it, and still cannot find a pattern. I would search for a solution online, for example, if I want to solve the problem related to navigation bar, I would go to the specific website that has a navigation menu, or search on a website called Stack Overflow.

        Although I spent a lot of time on this assignment, I learned a lot of html and css structure. Also in CSS, I learned various properties. Some of them are interesting, for example, transform and transition effects. Even though they are hard to incorporate into my design due to my lack of art talent, the process of discovery was still fun for me.
